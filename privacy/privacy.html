    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy applies to all of the information that is inputed (or collected) by Relog on all of the platforms it exists (currently iOS, iPadOS and macOS).</p>

    <h2>Stance on Privacy</h2>

    <p>Relog was designed with your privacy in mind and as a result we do not have the ability to access any of your personal information unless you explicitly choose to share it with us.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
        Relog utilizes the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/">Core Data</a> framework for data persistence and its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/mirroring_a_core_data_store_with_cloudkit/setting_up_core_data_with_cloudkit">built-in iCloud syncing solution</a> to sync data between your devices.
        As such we cannot view any information input into Relog without you manually sending us an exported form of your data.
        The iCloud developer console <i>does</i> provide us with a way to view your data but we would need your Apple ID credentials in order to do so (and we will never ask for them).
    </p>

    <p>Relog also provides you with the ability to export and (or) permanently delete all of your personal data should you ever choose to do so.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

    <p>We may update the privacy policy for Relog at any time and at our sole discretion. Your continued use of Relog after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.</p>

    <h2>Updates to this Policy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>1/15/24</b> - First Published.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy feel free to get in touch with us via email at lonnie (at) lonniegerol.com.</p>
